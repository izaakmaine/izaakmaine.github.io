<title>The Troubles of Nicodemus – Discourses of Christ and the Apostles</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The oil lamp flickered against the whitewashed walls of the upper room, casting dancing shadows that seemed to mirror the tumult in Nicodemus’s heart. He pulled his rich outer garment closer, though the spring night was mild in Jerusalem. The gesture was one of habit, an unconscious attempt to guard himself against the unsettling thoughts that had plagued him for weeks.
From his position on the rooftop, he could see the sprawl of Jerusalem’s houses below, their flat roofs silvered by moonlight. The Temple Mount rose in the distance, a darker mass against the star-strewn sky. How many nights had he spent there, poring over the sacred scrolls, debating fine points of the Law with his fellow Pharisees? He was a teacher of Israel, respected and learned, yet lately all his certainties had begun to crumble like dry clay." /><link rel="canonical" href="http://localhost:1313/discourses/docs/06-the-troubles-of-nicodemus/" itemprop="url" />

        <div class="content">
          <h1>The Troubles of Nicodemus</h1>
          <p>The oil lamp flickered against the whitewashed walls of the upper room, casting dancing shadows that seemed to mirror the tumult in Nicodemus&rsquo;s heart. He pulled his rich outer garment closer, though the spring night was mild in Jerusalem. The gesture was one of habit, an unconscious attempt to guard himself against the unsettling thoughts that had plagued him for weeks.</p>
<p>From his position on the rooftop, he could see the sprawl of Jerusalem&rsquo;s houses below, their flat roofs silvered by moonlight. The Temple Mount rose in the distance, a darker mass against the star-strewn sky. How many nights had he spent there, poring over the sacred scrolls, debating fine points of the Law with his fellow Pharisees? He was a teacher of Israel, respected and learned, yet lately all his certainties had begun to crumble like dry clay.</p>
<p>It had started with reports about the Galilean. At first, Nicodemus had dismissed them as he would any other tale of a wandering preacher – there were always such men, drawing crowds with wild promises and revolutionary fervor. But then had come the account of the wedding at Cana, from witnesses he trusted. Water transformed to wine. Then healings, not the dubious claims of traveling charlatans, but verified cures witnessed by hundreds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; his own students had asked him, &ldquo;what do you make of this Jesus of Nazareth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What indeed? The Sanhedrin was already muttering darkly about him, seeing a threat to their authority, to the delicate balance they maintained with Rome. But Nicodemus couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that there was something different about this man. The authority with which he taught, the signs he performed – they spoke of something beyond mere human power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God must be with him,&rdquo; Nicodemus had whispered to himself in the quiet hours of study. &ldquo;No one could do these signs unless God was with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought was simultaneously thrilling and terrifying. If God was truly with this man, then what did that mean for everything Nicodemus had built his life upon? The careful structure of interpretations and traditions that he had mastered – was it possible they had all missed something fundamental?</p>
<p>These questions had driven him here, to this modest house in one of Jerusalem&rsquo;s quieter quarters, where Jesus was said to be staying during the Passover festival. The streets below were empty now, the pilgrims and merchants all retired for the night. Only the occasional bark of a dog or distant call of a night watchman disturbed the silence.</p>
<p>Nicodemus had waited until well after sunset to come. He told himself it was to avoid the crowds that seemed to constantly surround Jesus, but in his heart, he knew the truth. He was afraid – not of Jesus himself, but of what his fellow Pharisees would say if they saw one of their own seeking out this controversial teacher.</p>
<p>A soft footfall on the stairs made him turn. The man who emerged onto the rooftop was younger than Nicodemus had expected, dressed simply in a worker&rsquo;s tunic. But there was something in his bearing, a quiet authority that made Nicodemus&rsquo;s carefully prepared opening words catch in his throat.</p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s eyes met his, and Nicodemus felt as though he was being seen – truly seen – for the first time in his life. Not the respected rabbi, not the member of the Sanhedrin, but the questioning soul beneath all those layers of learning and tradition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; Nicodemus finally managed, his voice barely above a whisper, &ldquo;we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight smile played at the corners of Jesus&rsquo;s mouth, but his eyes remained intense, penetrating. &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words hit Nicodemus like a physical blow. Born again? He had come seeking wisdom, perhaps confirmation of his growing suspicions about Jesus&rsquo;s divine authorization. Instead, he was confronted with what seemed like a riddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can someone be born when they are old?&rdquo; he asked, genuine confusion in his voice. &ldquo;Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother&rsquo;s womb to be born!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question came out more sharply than he had intended, colored by his frustration. This was not how he had imagined this conversation going. He was used to theological discussions that followed familiar patterns of scriptural interpretation and logical argument. But Jesus seemed to be speaking a different language entirely.</p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s response was patient but firm. &ldquo;Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jesus spoke, Nicodemus felt something shift in his understanding. The words were still mysterious, but they resonated with something deep within him – something that all his years of study had never quite reached. He thought of the prophets&rsquo; promises of a new heart, of God&rsquo;s Spirit poured out on all flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not be surprised at my saying, &lsquo;You must be born again,&rsquo;&rdquo; Jesus continued. &ldquo;The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night breeze stirred then, as if to emphasize Jesus&rsquo;s words, carrying with it the faint scent of blooming almond trees. Nicodemus closed his eyes, feeling its touch on his face. How often had he felt the wind without truly considering its mystery? He could not see it, could not control it, yet its effects were undeniable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can this be?&rdquo; he asked, but the question was different now – less a challenge and more a plea for understanding.</p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s voice took on a gentle note of rebuke. &ldquo;You are Israel&rsquo;s teacher, and do you not understand these things? Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words stung, but Nicodemus recognized their truth. How often had he and his fellow Pharisees dismissed teachings that didn&rsquo;t fit their preconceptions, even when the evidence of God&rsquo;s work was before their eyes? They had become so focused on preserving their understanding of the Law that they had lost the ability to recognize when God was doing something new.</p>
<p>Jesus continued, his words taking on a rhythmic quality that reminded Nicodemus of the prophetic writings he had studied all his life: &ldquo;I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came down from heaven – the Son of Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The implications of these words made Nicodemus&rsquo;s head spin. Was Jesus claiming to have come down from heaven? The boldness of the statement should have offended him, should have confirmed the accusations of blasphemy that some of his colleagues were already muttering. Instead, he found himself believing.</p>
<p>Then Jesus spoke words that would echo through Nicodemus&rsquo;s mind for the rest of his life: &ldquo;Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reference to Moses caught Nicodemus&rsquo;s attention. This was familiar ground – the story of the bronze serpent, lifted up to heal the Israelites who had been bitten by snakes in the wilderness. But Jesus was clearly pointing to something more, something both wonderful and terrible that Nicodemus couldn&rsquo;t quite grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words fell into the night air like stones into still water, sending ripples through Nicodemus&rsquo;s consciousness. Love – not the careful adherence to laws, not the accumulation of knowledge, but love – was at the heart of God&rsquo;s plan. And this love was expressed not in more rules or requirements, but in a gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicodemus felt tears forming in his eyes. How many times had he pronounced judgment on others, certain that he was defending God&rsquo;s honor? How many times had he seen God primarily as a judge, demanding perfect adherence to the Law? But here was a different vision – God as a father, reaching out in love to save rather than condemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the verdict,&rdquo; Jesus continued, his voice growing more intense. &ldquo;Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicodemus shifted uncomfortably, thinking of his own decision to come under cover of darkness. But Jesus wasn&rsquo;t finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words hung in the air between them. Nicodemus stood silent, his mind racing to process everything he had heard. The cool night air felt charged with possibility, as if he stood on the threshold of something momentous.</p>
<p>Jesus waited, his presence both challenging and compassionate. He had laid out truths that would take Nicodemus years to fully understand – about new birth, about God&rsquo;s love, about light and darkness, about the necessity of faith. But he had planted seeds that would grow deep roots in the fertile soil of Nicodemus&rsquo;s seeking heart.</p>
<p>Finally, Nicodemus spoke, his voice rough with emotion. &ldquo;Teacher, I&hellip; I need time to think about these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus nodded, understanding in his eyes. &ldquo;The Spirit of truth will guide you,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<p>As Nicodemus prepared to leave, he took one last look at Jesus. The man&rsquo;s words had shaken the foundations of everything he thought he knew, yet somehow he felt more grounded than ever before. He had come seeking answers and had instead found an invitation – an invitation to be born again, to step into the light, to know God not just as a subject of study but as a father who loved the world enough to send his Son.</p>
<p>The streets were still dark as Nicodemus made his way home, but something had changed inside him. He thought of his colleagues in the Sanhedrin, of their growing hostility toward Jesus, and knew that difficult days lay ahead. But he had glimpsed something true and beautiful that night – something that his fellow Pharisees, in their rigid certainty, couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Later, when Jesus was arrested and his followers scattered, Nicodemus would remember this night. He would remember it when he dared to speak up in the Sanhedrin, asking that Jesus be given a fair hearing. He would remember it most powerfully when he joined Joseph of Arimathea in taking Jesus&rsquo;s broken body from the cross, when he brought the expensive burial spices to honor the teacher who had spoken to him of new birth.</p>
<p>But for now, he walked through the sleeping city, the words echoing in his mind: &ldquo;For God so loved the world&hellip;&rdquo; The dawn was still hours away, but Nicodemus had begun his journey from darkness into light.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, Nicodemus found himself viewing everything differently. The morning prayers, the teaching sessions with his students, the debates in the Sanhedrin – all were colored by the memory of that rooftop conversation.</p>
<p>He noticed things he had never seen before: the hungry look in the eyes of the common people when they came to the Temple, seeking something more than ritual and regulation; the way his fellow Pharisees often seemed more concerned with maintaining their authority than with truly understanding God&rsquo;s will; the growing divide between those who saw Jesus as a threat and those who sensed, as he did, that something unprecedented was happening.</p>
<p>In quiet moments, he would return to Jesus&rsquo;s words about the wind of the Spirit. He began to recognize its movements in unexpected places – in the questions of his most earnest students, in the testimony of those who had been transformed by encounters with Jesus, in his own growing conviction that all his learning had only brought him to the threshold of true understanding.</p>
<p>The metaphor of new birth took on deeper meaning as he watched the spring unfold across Jerusalem. Just as the almond trees burst into bloom and new lambs tottered in the fields, so he felt something new struggling to be born within his own heart. His carefully constructed theological framework was being transformed into something more vital and mysterious.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t easy. There were moments of doubt, times when the weight of tradition and the pressure of his position seemed overwhelming. He would remember Jesus&rsquo;s words about those who loved darkness rather than light, and recognize his own tendency to retreat into the familiar shadows of conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>Yet he couldn&rsquo;t unknow what he had learned that night. The truth that God&rsquo;s love lay at the heart of everything, that this love had taken human form in Jesus, that new birth was possible – these insights had taken root too deeply to be easily dislodged.</p>
<p>His students began to notice changes in his teaching. Where once he had emphasized precise interpretation of the Law, now he spoke more often of God&rsquo;s mercy. He began to ask questions that led his students to consider the spirit behind the regulations, not just their letter. Some were puzzled by this new approach, but others found themselves drawn into deeper reflection about the nature of God and their relationship with Him.</p>
<p>In the Sanhedrin, Nicodemus became known for his thoughtful questions and his reluctance to join in the growing chorus of condemnation against Jesus. He didn&rsquo;t openly declare his growing conviction about Jesus&rsquo;s identity – the night visit still marked him as one who struggled with fear – but neither could he participate in the plots against him.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the quiet of his study, Nicodemus would unroll the sacred scrolls and read them with new eyes. The prophetic promises of a new covenant, of God&rsquo;s Spirit poured out, of hearts of stone transformed to hearts of flesh – they seemed to leap off the parchment with fresh significance. He began to understand that what he had witnessed that night was not a departure from Israel&rsquo;s faith, but its fulfillment.</p>
<p>The words about Moses lifting up the serpent particularly haunted him. As he meditated on them, he began to see layers of meaning he hadn&rsquo;t grasped during the conversation. The bronze serpent had been a symbol of the very thing that was killing the people, lifted up as the focus of their faith for healing. What did that suggest about Jesus&rsquo;s cryptic words about the Son of Man being lifted up?</p>
<p>These thoughts would come back to him with devastating clarity at Golgotha, when he saw Jesus lifted up in a very different way. But for now, they remained part of the mystery he was slowly beginning to understand – the mystery of God&rsquo;s love expressing itself through sacrifice, of new life emerging from death, of light penetrating darkness.</p>
<p>As Jerusalem filled with pilgrims for the Passover festival, Nicodemus watched Jesus&rsquo;s public ministry with growing amazement. The signs and wonders continued, but it was the teaching that most affected him now. He recognized in Jesus&rsquo;s public words the same themes he had heard that night – about God&rsquo;s kingdom, about spiritual rebirth, about light and darkness, about God&rsquo;s great love for the world.</p>
<p>He saw how different people responded to these teachings. Some, like his fellow religious leaders, reacted with hostility to anything that challenged their authority or understanding. Others, particularly among the common people, received the words with joy, as if they were water to parched ground. And some, like himself, found themselves caught between – drawn to the truth they sensed in Jesus&rsquo;s words but struggling with the implications of fully embracing them.</p>
<p>Nicodemus began to understand that what he had experienced that night was not just a private revelation but a glimpse of something that would transform the world. The new birth Jesus spoke of wasn&rsquo;t just for him alone – it was God&rsquo;s offer to all people, a universal invitation to step out of darkness into light, to be born again of water and Spirit, to become children of the God who loved the world enough to send his Son.</p>
<p>This understanding both thrilled and humbled him. All his years of study, his position in the Sanhedrin, his reputation as a teacher of Israel – none of these gave him any advantage in receiving this new life. Like everyone else, he had to come as a child, ready to be born again.</p>
<p>The image of child-like trust challenged him deeply. He had spent his life building expertise, earning respect, and maintaining control. The idea of becoming like a newborn – helpless, dependent, starting over – was profoundly counter to everything his position represented. Yet he could not escape the conviction that this was exactly what Jesus had been talking about.</p>
<p>In his teaching, he began to speak more often about the mystery of God&rsquo;s ways. Where once he would have claimed to have definitive answers, now he was more likely to acknowledge the limits of human understanding. Like the wind Jesus had spoken of, God&rsquo;s Spirit moved in ways that defied human control or comprehension.</p>
<p>This new humility didn&rsquo;t make him less effective as a teacher – if anything, it made him more so. His students found themselves drawn into genuine exploration rather than mere memorization of accepted interpretations. Some even began to ask questions about Jesus, sensing their teacher&rsquo;s hidden knowledge of him.</p>
<p>As tensions in Jerusalem rose and the controversy around Jesus grew, Nicodemus found himself increasingly caught between worlds. In the Sanhedrin, he heard the angry debates and watched the plots taking shape. In the streets, he saw the impact of Jesus&rsquo;s ministry – lives transformed, hope awakened, a new kind of community forming.</p>
<p>He thought often of that night&rsquo;s conversation, of how Jesus had seemed to see right through his carefully constructed facade to the seeking heart beneath. He remembered the mixture of rebuke and compassion in Jesus&rsquo;s voice when he had questioned how a teacher of Israel could not understand these things.</p>
