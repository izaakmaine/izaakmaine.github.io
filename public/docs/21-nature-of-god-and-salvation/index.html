<title>Nature of God and Salvation – Discourses of Christ and the Apostles</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The evening air was thick with anticipation as Jesus and his disciples gathered in the olive grove outside Jerusalem. The ancient trees cast long shadows in the fading light, their gnarled branches seeming to reach toward the darkening sky like supplicants in prayer. The disciples had noticed their Master was particularly contemplative today, his eyes holding that distant look they had come to associate with moments of profound teaching.
Peter was the first to break the silence, his weathered fisherman’s hands clasped together as he leaned forward. “Master, we have seen you perform miracles that defy understanding. We have heard you speak of your Father in heaven with such intimacy. Tell us more about the nature of God, that we might better understand.”" /><link rel="canonical" href="http://localhost:1313/discourses/docs/21-nature-of-god-and-salvation/" itemprop="url" />

          <h1>Nature of God and Salvation</h1>
          <p>The evening air was thick with anticipation as Jesus and his disciples gathered in the olive grove outside Jerusalem. The ancient trees cast long shadows in the fading light, their gnarled branches seeming to reach toward the darkening sky like supplicants in prayer. The disciples had noticed their Master was particularly contemplative today, his eyes holding that distant look they had come to associate with moments of profound teaching.</p>
<p>Peter was the first to break the silence, his weathered fisherman&rsquo;s hands clasped together as he leaned forward. &ldquo;Master, we have seen you perform miracles that defy understanding. We have heard you speak of your Father in heaven with such intimacy. Tell us more about the nature of God, that we might better understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus smiled gently, his eyes scanning the familiar faces around him – men who had left everything to follow him, yet still struggled to comprehend the full magnitude of what they were part of. &ldquo;My beloved friends,&rdquo; he began, his voice soft yet carrying clearly in the evening stillness, &ldquo;you seek to understand the nature of my Father, yet how can one contain the infinite in words? It is like trying to hold the ocean in a cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas, ever the skeptic, furrowed his brow. &ldquo;But Master, if we cannot understand God, how can we truly follow Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Thomas,&rdquo; Jesus replied, shifting to face him directly. &ldquo;You seek to understand with your mind what must first be grasped with your heart. Think of how the sun gives light and warmth to all creation, asking nothing in return. This is but a pale reflection of my Father&rsquo;s nature. His love flows endlessly, touching all things, sustaining all life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John, the youngest among them, leaned forward eagerly. &ldquo;Is this why you often speak of God as Father? To help us understand His love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear John,&rdquo; Jesus nodded, his expression warming. &ldquo;But even this metaphor falls short. When I speak of God as Father, I speak of a love deeper than any earthly parent could manifest – a love that existed before the foundations of the world were laid, a love that will endure beyond the last star&rsquo;s light fading from the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples exchanged glances, trying to grasp the magnitude of such love. The evening breeze stirred the olive branches above them, creating a gentle rustling that seemed to echo the movement of the Spirit Jesus so often spoke about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Master,&rdquo; Andrew interjected, his voice tentative, &ldquo;if God&rsquo;s love is so vast and unconditional, why do we need salvation? Why can&rsquo;t all simply come to Him as they are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s expression grew more serious, though his eyes remained gentle. &ldquo;Consider a man born in a darkened cave, who has never known the light of day. Though the sun shines bright outside, until he steps out of the darkness, he cannot experience its warmth. Salvation is not about changing God&rsquo;s love for you – that is constant and unchangeable. It is about transforming you so that you can receive and reflect that love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this why you speak so often of being born again?&rdquo; Philip asked, his merchant&rsquo;s mind always seeking to connect concepts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Jesus replied, picking up an olive branch that had fallen to the ground. &ldquo;Look at this branch. Now that it is separated from the tree, it can no longer bear fruit. It may keep its leaves for a time, but it has been cut off from its source of life. Humanity, in its broken state, is like this branch – separated from the source of all life and love. Salvation is about being grafted back into the true vine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew, the former tax collector who understood all too well the need for redemption, spoke up. &ldquo;But how, Lord? How does one become&hellip; grafted back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus stood now, moving to the center of their circle. The last rays of sunlight caught his profile, seeming to illuminate him from within. &ldquo;It begins with recognition – seeing your true state. Then comes repentance – turning away from darkness toward light. But these are merely the first steps. True salvation is a transformation so complete that it is indeed like being born anew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak of being born of water and the Spirit,&rdquo; Nathanael recalled. &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water cleanses the outside, but the Spirit transforms the inside,&rdquo; Jesus explained, his voice taking on a teaching tone they all recognized. &ldquo;Think of a potter working with clay. The water makes the clay pliable, but it is the potter&rsquo;s hands that give it new form. So too must you be made pliable by repentance, then transformed by the Spirit&rsquo;s touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James, who had been quietly contemplating, finally spoke. &ldquo;Master, you say that God&rsquo;s love is unlimited, yet you also speak of judgment. How can these both be true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s response was measured, each word carefully chosen. &ldquo;Consider a father whose child is playing with fire. Does his love not compel him to intervene? Would it be loving to allow the child to burn themselves? God&rsquo;s judgment flows from His love, not in opposition to it. He judges what harms His children, what separates them from Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The darkness was deepening now, and someone had lit a small fire in their midst. The flames cast dancing shadows on their faces as Jesus continued, &ldquo;But understand this – judgment is not God&rsquo;s desire. His heart is for restoration, for return, for redemption. Like the shepherd who leaves ninety-nine sheep to seek the one that is lost, so is my Father&rsquo;s heart toward His children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter, always quick to respond, asked with characteristic boldness, &ldquo;Then why do you speak of a narrow gate and a difficult path? If God wishes all to return to Him, why make the way hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s laugh was gentle but carried a note of sadness. &ldquo;Oh Peter, the path is not hard because God made it so, but because of what we must leave behind to walk it. It is like a man trying to pass through a narrow doorway while carrying many bundles. The door is not the obstacle – it is his unwillingness to set down his burdens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What burdens must we set down, Lord?&rdquo; John asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pride, first among them,&rdquo; Jesus replied, his gaze moving from face to face. &ldquo;The belief that you can save yourselves. The illusion of self-sufficiency. The love of darkness that makes you shield your eyes from light. The attachments to things that can never satisfy your deepest hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A contemplative silence fell over the group. The fire crackled, sending sparks upward into the night sky. After a moment, Thomas spoke again, his voice carrying a hint of frustration. &ldquo;Master, sometimes your words seem like riddles. Can you not speak plainly about these matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s response was patient. &ldquo;Thomas, if I spoke of the full glory of God&rsquo;s nature, it would be like trying to describe colors to a man born blind. So I speak in ways you can understand, using the things of earth to point toward heavenly truths. But know this – the time is coming when you will understand more fully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this why you use so many parables?&rdquo; Matthew asked, his scribe&rsquo;s mind always eager to understand the method behind the teaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jesus nodded. &ldquo;The parables are like windows that let in light gradually, allowing your eyes to adjust. For those who truly seek understanding, they reveal deeper truths with each telling. For those who resist the light, they remain merely stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judas, who had been unusually quiet throughout the evening, finally spoke. &ldquo;But surely, Master, God&rsquo;s nature must be more&hellip; practical than this. What of power? What of authority? What of establishing right order in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other disciples shifted uncomfortably at Judas&rsquo;s words, but Jesus met his gaze steadily. &ldquo;You speak of power as the world understands it, Judas. But God&rsquo;s power is revealed in seeming weakness. His authority is demonstrated through service. His order is established not through force, but through love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Judas muttered, looking away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider a seed,&rdquo; Jesus continued, his voice gentle but firm. &ldquo;It must be buried in darkness, seemingly dead and powerless, before it can bring forth new life. This is God&rsquo;s way – life from death, strength from weakness, victory through surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip, practical as always, asked, &ldquo;Then how should we live, Master? How do we align ourselves with this divine nature you speak of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus stood, walking slowly around their circle as he spoke. &ldquo;You begin by recognizing that you cannot earn what is freely given. Salvation is a gift, not a wage. But once received, it transforms everything – how you see, how you think, how you love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like how you love, Master?&rdquo; John asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are learning to see, beloved one,&rdquo; Jesus smiled. &ldquo;Yes, the love I show you is a reflection of the Father&rsquo;s love. When you love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you, give without expecting return – these are not merely commands to be obeyed, but invitations to participate in divine nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew leaned forward earnestly. &ldquo;But Master, surely such love is impossible for mere humans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your own, yes,&rdquo; Jesus agreed. &ldquo;This is why I speak of being born of the Spirit. The life I call you to is not one you can live by your own strength. It must be lived through you by the Spirit of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night had fully fallen now, and the stars were brilliant above them. Jesus pointed upward. &ldquo;Look at the stars. Each one is held in its course by my Father&rsquo;s power, yet He knows them each by name. So too does He know you – every hair on your head, every thought in your heart, every fear that keeps you awake at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples followed his gaze upward, their faces reflecting both wonder and uncertainty. Peter, ever the spokesman, voiced what many were thinking: &ldquo;It seems too good to be true, Lord. That the Creator of all this would care about us so personally&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Peter,&rdquo; Jesus replied, his voice full of affection, &ldquo;you still think too little of God&rsquo;s love, not too much. The truth is far more wonderful than you can imagine. The God who spoke the stars into being desires not subjects, but children. Not servants, but friends. Not mere obedience, but intimate communion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this why you came?&rdquo; John asked quietly. &ldquo;To show us this love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jesus answered, and something in his voice made them all look at him intently. &ldquo;I came to reveal the Father&rsquo;s heart, to bridge the chasm between divine and human, to make a way for you to enter into the life you were created for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a weight to his words that made several of the disciples shift uneasily. They had learned to recognize when their Master was about to reveal something significant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time is coming,&rdquo; Jesus continued, his voice both tender and heavy with purpose, &ldquo;when you will see just how far God&rsquo;s love will go to restore what was lost. The light must confront the darkness fully before the new dawn can break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak of suffering, don&rsquo;t you, Master?&rdquo; John asked, his young face troubled.</p>
<p>Jesus reached out and touched John&rsquo;s shoulder gently. &ldquo;I speak of love, dear one. Love that will not count the cost. Love that will demonstrate once and for all that there is no length to which God will not go to bring His children home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire had burned low, casting deep shadows across their faces. In the darkness, Jesus&rsquo;s words seemed to hang in the air with particular weight: &ldquo;Remember this night, beloved ones. Remember that before anything else – before your striving, before your service, before your sacrifices – you are loved. This is the foundation of all things. This is the truth that will sustain you when the darkness seems overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we be sure?&rdquo; Thomas asked, giving voice to the doubt that sometimes plagued them all. &ldquo;How can we know this love is real and not just beautiful words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s smile was gentle but held a trace of sorrow. &ldquo;You will see, Thomas. Soon you will all see the lengths to which love will go. But for tonight, know this: the God who counts the stars and knows when a sparrow falls knows you fully and loves you completely. This is not earned – it simply is. Like the air you breathe, it surrounds you always, whether you acknowledge it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood then, brushing the dust from his robe. &ldquo;It grows late, and tomorrow holds its own challenges. But carry these words in your hearts: salvation is not about earning God&rsquo;s love – it&rsquo;s about awakening to the love that has always been there, letting it transform you from within, and learning to live as beloved children rather than fearful servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples began to stir, preparing to make their way back to where they were staying. But Jesus&rsquo;s voice stopped them one final time: &ldquo;One more thing, my friends. The truths we&rsquo;ve spoken of tonight – they&rsquo;re not meant just for you. They&rsquo;re meant for all who will believe through your word. The love we&rsquo;ve discussed, the salvation we&rsquo;ve explored – these are not limited by time or place or people. They are as vast as my Father&rsquo;s heart, which encompasses all creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they made their way back through the darkness, each disciple was lost in thought, turning over the words they had heard like precious stones, examining them from different angles, trying to grasp their full significance. They didn&rsquo;t yet understand that this intimate evening of teaching would become one of their most treasured memories, a conversation they would recall and relate countless times in the years to come.</p>
<p>The stars continued their eternal dance overhead, bearing silent witness to truths too vast for human words to fully capture, yet simple enough for a child to grasp: that at the heart of all things lies love, that this love has a face and a name, and that through this love, all things would ultimately be made new.</p>
<p>As they disappeared into the darkness, Jesus&rsquo;s words seemed to linger in the olive grove: &ldquo;Remember, beloved ones. Remember that you are loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the years to come, through persecution and hardship, through triumph and tragedy, through the building of the early church and the spreading of the gospel to the ends of the earth, they would indeed remember. They would remember not just the words, but the love they had witnessed firsthand – a love that had walked among them, taught them, served them, and ultimately given everything for them.</p>
